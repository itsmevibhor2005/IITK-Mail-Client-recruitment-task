I have made 2 pages:

. 1st page is the inbox page in which inboxes are shown and on clicking on an inbox the corresponding mail opens.

. 2nd page (/compose) is the compose page in which I have made a template to compose an Email.

I have made a JSON file in which I have some data of the dummy Emails which I have fetched in the main react file

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
